  <h1>MUPKINZ - the Kids Library</h1>

MUPKINZ is really an innovative and novel concept. Since the branded Toys, Books and CDs 
are becoming expensive day by day, it is really difficult for parents to fulfill their 
child’s ever increasing demand for these items. We also know that kids get bored of these 
items within a week or so and demand new toys, books, CDs again & again. Khilonewala Library 
provides solution to all such problems faced by parents and still remains very affordable as 
we provide these items on RENT. At Khilonewala we believe in spreading the happiness among 
parents & bring smiles on faces of children in a very unique way. 

<h1>MUPKINZ Kids Library concept is simple Play > Return > Get New </h1>

To enjoy the benefit of MUPKINZ library the parents need to take a membership with the library 
and they will get a kit of Toys/Books/CDs at their door-step every 2 weeks. There is one time 
Registration fees of Rs 500 for a child which is Non-Refundable. Monthly subscription option ranges 
from Rs 350 for Silver / Rs 450 for Gold / Rs 750 for Diamond depending on the plan chosen.

Lets understand the membership plan with a simple example. Suppose a member has taken a GOLD Plan 
in which he pay’s Rs 450 monthly and get Rs 4500 worth of Toys/Books/CDs in a month’s time. 
This Rs 5500 is divided in 2 parts in 2 deliveries.
(Suppose in 1 delivery the member gets …1 Toy of Rs 1500 + 2  Toy of Rs 400 + 3  Toy of Rs 300 + 
1 Book of Rs 300 and in 2 delivery after two weeks the member gets 1 Toy of Rs 2000  + 2  Toy of Rs 400 + 
3  Toy of Rs 250 + 1 Book of Rs 350,  Total Value of items Rs 5500 in 2 deliveries) which will be delivered
to the member at their door step free of cost. 

In 1 Delivery the member will get few Toys, Books & CDs which will be with him for 2 weeks , after 
two week this kit will be exchanged with a newer kit with all different items in it ... So in all 
2 kits of total value of Rs 5500 worth of material will be enjoyed by a member in a month.

MUPKINZ has value for money plans and members gets discount if they opt for longer duration plans. 
For e.g.  If they opt for Gold Half Yearly Plan it costs them Rs 2400 in which they get Rs 33000 worth 
of Toys/Books/CDs divided in 12 kits delivered every 2 week at their door-step free of cost. 
 
The collection of items that you get from MUPKINZ will all be branded i.e. from national or international 
companies only. Overall, you will have more than 50 - 60 brands in your collection of Toys/Books/CDs, 
so that your member (parents) gets huge variety to choose for their children.
 
Remember, opportunity knocks only once, so step forward and grab this opportunity to enter the amazing 
new world of Renting Toys, Books and CDs through MUPKINZ – the Kids Library.
